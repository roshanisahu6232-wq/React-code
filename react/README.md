# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.





## 3. What is JSX? What are the rules to rite JSX?

-  JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
-  It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript files.
-  It was introduced by Facebook (Meta) for React.

There rules are:-

1. Return Only One Parent Element
2. All Tags (including Self-Closing Tags) Must Be Properly Closed .
3. Use CamelCase for Attributes (ex:- onclick, onChange)
4. JavaScript Expressions in {}
5. To write comment in JSX use
   `{/* */}`
6. Don't use if-else directly inside JSX instead use ternary or logical operator.
7. Use className instead of class.
8. Use htmlFor instead of for in label tag.

## 4. What is a component in React? Types of component?

A component in React is a reusable(self-contained) piece of code that returns some piece of JSX.

It is of 2 types

1. Class Based component(CBC)
   - A Class Component is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component.
   - It has render() method to return JSX.
   - It was the traditional way of writing React components before 2019.

2. Function Based Component (FBC)
   - A function based component is a simple javascript function which returns some piece of jsx.
   - It is now the recommended and most popular way to write components in modern React.

## 5. What is React.Fragment and What is Empty Fragment?

1. Fragment:- A wrapper component that lets you group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node to the HTML output.

2. Empty Fragment:- A shorthand syntax for React.Fragment that does the same thing — groups elements without extra DOM nodes — but doesn't support the key prop.

Note:- we can not write id and className attribute in both fragment.

## 6. What is Component Composition?

Component Composition is the practice of calling one component inside another component.

#### Example

```
function Header() {
  return <h1>Welcome</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />  {/* Header component called inside App */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 7. What is Props?

Props (short for "properties") are a mechanism used to pass data from one component to another, typically in a unidirectional (top-down) flow from parent to child.

#### Example

```
  // Parent passes props
  <Greeting name="Alice" age={25} />

  // Child receives and uses them
  function Greeting({ name, age }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.</h1>;
  }
```

## 8. what is default props?

Default props in React allow you to define fallback values for a component's properties (props)

#### Example
```
function Greeting({ name = "Guest", age = 18 }) {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.</h1>
  );
}

<Greeting />
Component call Without passing props:
```


## 9. Why we use Props or characteristics of props?

##### Characteristics
- Immutable:- a child component cannot modify its own props
- Unidirectional:- data flows only from parent → child
- Any type:- strings, numbers, arrays, objects, functions, even JSX
- Destructured:- commonly destructured in the function signature for cleaner code

##### Usecase
- Pass Data:- Send data from parent component to child component
- Reusability:- Same component can be used multiple times with different data
- Dynamic Content:- Components show different content based on props received
- Avoid Repetition:- Write the component once, reuse it anywhere
- Communication:- The only way for a parent to talk to a child component

## 10. What is Children prop?
 1. children prop is a special, built-in property that allows you to pass content between the opening and closing tags of a component.
 2. Anything placed inside a component's tags is automatically passed to that component as props.children.
 3. Children can be strings, numbers, JSX elements, arrays, or even functions.

 #### Example
 ```
  function Card({ children }) {
    return <div className="card">{children}</div>;
  }

  // Now you can put ANYTHING inside Card Component
  <Card>
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Description here</p>
  </Card>
 ```

## 11. What is Props Drilling?
  1. Prop Drilling is the process of passing data (props) through multiple layers of components to reach a deeply nested child that needs it, even if the intermediate components do not use that data

  ##### NOTE: To avoid props drilling we use context API, React State Management Libraries.

  #### Example
  ```
      // ✅ Data starts here in Parent
      function Parent() {
        const name = "Alice";
        const age = 25;

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>I am Parent</h1>
            <Child name={name} age={age} />  {/* passing to Child */}
          </div>
        );
      }


      // ✅ Child receives and passes down to SubChild
      function Child({ name, age }) {
        return (
          <div>
            <h2>I am Child</h2>
            <SubChild name={name} age={age} />  {/* passing to SubChild */}
          </div>
        );
      }


      // ✅ SubChild finally uses the data
      function SubChild({ name, age }) {
        return (
          <div>
            <h3>I am SubChild</h3>
            <p>Name: {name}</p>
            <p>Age: {age}</p>
          </div>
        );
      }
  ```


## 12. What is render prop?
 1. Render Prop is when you pass a function as a prop to a component, and that component calls the function to render something.

 #### Example
 ```
      // Component accepts a function as a prop
      function Greet({ render }) {
        return <div>{render("Alice")}</div>; // calls the function
      }

      // Passing a function as a prop
      <Greet render={(name) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>} />

      // Output → Hello, Alice!
 ```
